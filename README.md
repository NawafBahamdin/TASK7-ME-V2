# 7 The seventh task in Mechanical Engineering Path
In this task, I will draw the robot arm, taking into account the places of the Servo motor and the bearing, and each of them will be explained in this report.
## 7.1 Servo Motor[1]
A Servo Motor is a Rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. Servo Motors comes in different sizes and shapes, but the basic working principle of all Servo Motors is exactly the same.

### 7.1.1 Some Specifications of Servo motor:
* Weight: 55 g
* Dimension: 40.7 x 19.7 x 42.9 mm approx.
### 7.1.2 Advantages of Servo Motor:
* Low Cost
* Smooth rotation at low speeds
### 7.1.3 Servo motor applications:
* Camera Auto Focus.
* Solar Tracking Systems
* In Robots Arms

## 7.2 Bearing[2]
Bearing is considered one of the most important elements in mechanical systems that are used to carry the shaft and its ability to withstand high speeds

### 7.2.1 Bearing Type
SKF manufactures virtually every type of ball and roller bearing. They are available in various cross-sections and satisfy a huge variety of operating conditions and application performance requirements. A wide assortment of plain bearings, rod ends, and bushings are also available to satisfy various oscillating movement needs.

A file shows the types of bearings manufactured by the SKF

## 7.2 Work
The Solidworks program was used to draw the arm with the highest accuracy and follow-up with the engineer Ibrahim, who thankfully explained the most important measurements for the holes and arm lengths. Figure show the drawing sheet of Chatbot to clarify the important sizes for drawing the arm
